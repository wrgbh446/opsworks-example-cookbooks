Maven2 Cookbook
=============

Chef cookbook to install and configure the Maven
(www.playframework.org).

There is a lot that could be done to increase the functionality of this
cookbook. I only need it for one particular context, but I would like to
eventually add or at least confirm support on other platforms as well as add
some options to how it's installed. Hopefully I'll get to do that soon!
